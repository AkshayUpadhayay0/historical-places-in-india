                                   Badrinath or Badrinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu which is
                                   situated in the town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India. The temple is also one of
                                   the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Badrinath—holy shrines
                                   for Vaishnavites.

                                   The name of the Badrinath tirtha originates from the local word badri which is a type
                                   of a wild berry. It is said that when Lord Vishnu sat in penance in these mountains,
                                   His consort Goddess Laxmi took the form of a berry tree and shaded Him from the harsh
                                   sun. It is not only the dwelling place of the Lord Himself but also home to countless
                                   pilgrims, saints and sages, who meditate here in search of enlightenment.

                                   Ayodhya, located on the banks of river Sarayu in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the seven
                                   sacred cities for Hindus. Ayodhya plays a critical role in the Hindu epic of Ramayana
                                   as it is believed to be the birthplace of Lord Rama. This religious town is also the
                                   birthplace of four of Jainism's 24 Tirthankaras (religious teachers), beckoning
                                   tourists with its serene ghats.

                                   With monkeys galore, the buzz of the visiting tourists, and a general spiritual aura,
                                   Ayodhya has been surrounded by controversy since about a decade now. It is the site
                                   of the 1992 Indian riots related to the Babri Masjid fiasco. The mosque, which was
                                   allegedly built on Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, became the bone of contention between
                                   Hindus and Muslims. In 2005, Ayodhya witnessed a terrorist attack at the site of
                                   Ramlalla Temple.

                                   Despite the controversy, Ayodhya has so much colour and spirituality to see for its
                                   tourists and has emerged as a significant spiritual centre. The land of multi-faith
                                   temples, the traffic-free streets of Ayodhya are intriguing enough in itself to
                                   warrant a visit.

                                   Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the
                                   world. Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain,
                                   the English author and literature, who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of
                                   Benaras, once wrote :
                                   “Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and
                                   looks twice as old as all of them put together”.

                                   The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for
                                   ages. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would
                                   attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth. Abode of Lord
                                   Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown. Ganges in Varanasi is
                                   believed to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals. Hindus believe that one
                                   who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from
                                   the cycle of birth and re-birth.

                                   Located near the famous Golden Temple of Amritsar, Jallianwala Bagh is a public
                                   garden that also houses a memorial to commemorate the massacre of peaceful
                                   celebrators by the British forces. Spread over 6.5 acres of land, Jallianwala Bagh is
                                   associated with one of the saddest days in Indian History when thousands of innocent
                                   people were killed on the orders of General Dyer as they gathered for a peaceful
                                   celebration of Baisakhi. The place has now been turned into a beautiful park and is
                                   managed by the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust.

                                   There is a memorial tablet at the entrance which serves as a record of history. The
                                   tragic incident left a deep scar on the country, and a memorial was constructed post
                                   the independence for the innocents who lost their lives in this devastating incident.
                                   Established by the government of India in 1951, the massacre memorial was inaugurated
                                   by Dr Rajendra Prasad on 13th April 1961.

                                   Mathura is a city and the administrative headquarters of Mathura district in the
                                   Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
                                   It is located approximately 57.6 kilometres north of Agra, and 166
                                   kilometres south-east of Delhi; about 14.5 kilometres from the town
                                   of Vrindavan, and 22 kilometres from Govardhan. In ancient times, Mathura was
                                   an economic hub, located at the junction of important caravan routes. The 2011 Census
                                   of India estimated the population of Mathura at 441,894.

                                   In Hinduism, Mathura is birthplace of Krishna, which is located at the Krishna
                                   Janmasthan Temple Complex. It is one of the Sapta Puri, the seven cities
                                   considered holy by Hindus. The Kesava Deo Temple was built in ancient times on the
                                   site of Krishna's birthplace (an underground prison). Mathura was the capital of the
                                   kingdom of Surasena, ruled by Kansa, the maternal uncle of Krishna. Janmashtami is
                                   grandly celebrated in Mathura every year.

                                   Mathura has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for the Heritage City
                                   Development and Augmentation Yojana scheme of Government of India.

                                   Harmandir Sahib, Harmandir also spelled Harimandir, also called Darbar Sahib
                                   (Punjabi: “Sacred Audience”) or Golden Temple, the chief gurdwara, or house of
                                   worship, of Sikhism and the Sikhs’ most important pilgrimage site. It is located in
                                   the city of Amritsar, Punjab state, northwestern India.

                                   The first Harmandir Sahib was built in 1604 by Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, who
                                   symbolically had it placed on a lower level so that even the humblest had to step
                                   down to enter it. He also included entrances on all four sides, signifying that it
                                   was open to worshippers of all castes and creeds. The foundation stone was laid by
                                   Mian Mīr, a Muslim divine of Lahore (now in Pakistan). The temple was destroyed
                                   several times by Afghan invaders and was finally rebuilt in marble and copper
                                   overlaid with gold foil during the reign (1801–39) of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The
                                   structure thus became known as the Golden Temple.

                                   One of the most popular historic places in India is the Gateway of India. One of the
                                   most iconic landmarks in the country, it was built by the British in 1924. It was
                                   actually built as an entry and exit point during the British period, and inaugurated
                                   by the Viceroy, the Earl of Reading. Today, however, it has become a favorite picnic
                                   spot for locals and tourists alike.

                                   On any given day, one can spot dozens of street vendors serving tasty snacks along
                                   with balloon sellers, thereby lending a happening vibe to the entire place. The
                                   Gateway of India has been reinforced repeatedly over the years with yellow basalt and
                                   concrete. In addition, the turrets are decorated with delicate lattice work.

                                   The All India War Memorial, popularly known as the India Gate, is located along the
                                   Rajpath in New Delhi. The imposing structure of India Gate is an awe-inspiring sight
                                   and is often compared to the Arch de Triomphe in France, the Gateway of India in
                                   Mumbai and the Arch of Constantine in Rome. This 42-meter tall historical structure
                                   was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of the largest war memorials in the
                                   country. India Gate is also famous for hosting the Republic Day Parade every year.

                                   Dedicated to 82,000 Indian and British soldiers who died during the First World War
                                   and the Third Anglo-Afghan War, this monument has the names of 13,300 servicemen
                                   inscribed on its surface. The premises of India Gate also houses the Amar Jawan
                                   Jyoti, which is a kindled structure right underneath the archway. Owing to its rich
                                   historical background and astonishing architecture, India Gate has become one of the
                                   most popular picnic spots in the city.
